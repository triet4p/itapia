ITAPIA is an intelligent stock investment assistant platform, built with the core philosophies of **transparency** and **Explainability (XAI)**. This project does not just provide recommendations, but also empowers users to understand the "why" behind each decision.

### The Problem & ITAPIA's Solution

*   **The Problem:** The current market is flooded with "black box" investment tools that issue cryptic buy/sell signals, eroding trust and turning investing into a game of chance.
*   **Our Solution:** We built a "glass box". By combining traditional AI/ML models with a powerful Rule Engine, every piece of advice is traced back to the "evidence" and "rules" that triggered it, giving users full control and confidence.

### üìà Key Features

*   üß† **Hybrid AI Architecture:** Combines the strengths of traditional Machine Learning models (Forecasting), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and a symbolic Rule Engine for reasoning.
*   üîç **Explainable Recommendations (XAI):** Every piece of advice on Decisions, Risks, and Opportunities is accompanied by a list of triggered rules as evidence.
*   üß¨ **Evolvable Rule Engine:** Built on a foundation of Symbolic Expression Trees, ready for the application of genetic algorithms to automatically discover new strategies.
*   üë§ **Personalized Investment Profiles:** Allows users to create and experiment with multiple investment "personas," each with unique parameters for risk appetite, goals, and experience.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Modern Full-Stack System:** Fully built with a Backend (Python, FastAPI, Docker) and Frontend (Vue.js, TypeScript, Vuetify), delivering a smooth and professional user experience.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

ITAPIA is designed with a microservices architecture, ensuring modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

### üöÄ Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
*   Git
*   Docker & Docker Compose
*   Python (Python 3.11 is recommended)
*   npm
*   OpenSSL

#### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/itapia.git
cd itapia
```

#### 2. Environment Setup & Credentials

Before running the project, you need to prepare the following secrets:

**a. Get Kaggle API Key:**
*   Log in to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
*   Go to your account page (click your avatar -> Account).
*   In the "API" section, click **"Create New API Token"**.
*   A `kaggle.json` file will be downloaded. Open it; you will need the `username` and `key` values.

**b. Get Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**
*   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project.
*   Navigate to **APIs & Services** -> **OAuth consent screen**, select **External**, and fill in the required application details. Add the `.../auth/userinfo.email` and `.../auth/userinfo.profile` scopes.
*   Go to **Credentials**, click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** -> **OAuth client ID**.
*   Select **Web application** and configure the following:
    *   **Authorized JavaScript origins:** `http://localhost:3000`
    *   **Authorized redirect URIs:** `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/google/callback`
*   After creation, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

**c. Generate JWT Secret Key:**
*   Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    openssl rand -hex 32
    ```
*   Copy the generated random string.

**d. Configure `.env` files:**
Copy the configuration files from the provided templates and fill in the necessary values.
```bash
# Backend
cp ./backend/.env.template ./backend/.env

# Frontend
cp ./frontend/.env.template ./frontend/.env
```

#### 3. Run the Backend

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Build and run all backend services in detached mode
docker-compose up --build -d api-gateway
```

#### 4. Run the Frontend

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Sync schemas if necessary
npm run sync:schemas

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

#### 5. Access the System
*   **Frontend Application:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
*   **Backend API Docs (Swagger UI):** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
