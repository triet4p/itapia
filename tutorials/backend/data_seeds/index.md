# Tutorial: data_seeds

This project, `data_seeds`, is responsible for **initializing a database** with all its necessary starting information. It acts like a builder that first sets up the *structure* by creating tables, then carefully *furnishes* it by adding default data in a specific, integrity-preserving order. Crucially, it also ensures that all *predefined operational rules* are loaded, enabling the application to function correctly from its very first run.
