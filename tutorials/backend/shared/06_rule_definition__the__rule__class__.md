# Chapter 6: Rule Definition (The `Rule` class)

Welcome back! In our previous chapter, [Chapter 5: Rule Logic Tree (Nodes)](05_rule_logic_tree__nodes__.md), we learned how to build powerful "decision-making machines" using **nodes** as LEGO bricks, connecting them into a **logic tree** to evaluate complex conditions. We saw how this tree could, for example, tell us if "RSI is oversold AND the forecast is positive."

## The Problem: What Makes a Complete Recipe?

Now that we have these amazing logic trees, what's missing? Imagine you've created a fantastic set of cooking instructions (your logic tree) for a special dish. That's great, but it's not a complete recipe card yet, is it? A true recipe card also needs:

*   **A name:** "Grandma's Secret Sauce"
*   **A description:** "A rich, savory sauce perfect for pasta or meats."
*   **Its purpose:** "Main Course Sauce" (not a dessert!)
*   **Its status:** "Ready to Cook," "Needs more salt," or "Deprecated"
*   **And, of course, the instructions!**

Similarly, in our `shared` project, a `_TreeNode` is just the *logic*. A complete **Rule** in `itapia` needs much more than just a logic tree. It needs metadata (information *about* the rule) to make it useful, manageable, and understandable. For instance, if a logic tree spits out the number `1.0`, does that mean "Buy," "High Risk," or "Great Opportunity"? The tree alone doesn't tell us; the **Rule Definition** does.

How do we bundle our intelligent logic trees with all the necessary descriptive information so that they become fully-fledged, actionable rules within `itapia`?

## The Solution: The `Rule` Class (Our "Recipe Card")

This is where the **`Rule` class** comes in! Think of the `Rule` class as the **central container** or the **complete "recipe card"** for a business rule. It takes a powerful logic tree (from [Chapter 5](05_rule_logic_tree__nodes__.md)) and wraps it with all the essential metadata needed to understand, manage, and use that rule effectively.

Each `Rule` object holds:
*   Its unique ID, name, description, and status.
*   Its *purpose* (e.g., "Decision Signal" for buying/selling, "Risk Level", "Opportunity Rating").
*   The actual "logic tree" (the `root` node) that defines its calculations.
*   A special method called `execute()` that knows how to run its logic tree against a [Consolidated Analysis Report](04_consolidated_analysis_reports__.md) and give us a numerical score.

The `Rule` class brings everything together, making our complex logic trees usable and meaningful.

## Key Concepts: What's on Our Rule "Recipe Card"?

Let's look at the main ingredients of a `Rule` object.

### 1. The Logic Tree (`root`)

At its heart, every `Rule` contains a `root` property. This `root` is the starting `OperatorNode` of the decision-making logic tree we learned about in [Chapter 5](05_rule_logic_tree__nodes__.md). The `Rule` class doesn't define *how* the logic tree works; it just *holds* it.

```python
# From itapia_common/rules/rule.py (simplified)
from .nodes import OperatorNode # Our 'root' must be an OperatorNode

class Rule:
    def __init__(
        self,
        root: OperatorNode, # This is the core logic tree!
        rule_id: str | None = None,
        name: str = "Untitled Rule",
        # ... other metadata ...
    ):
        if not isinstance(root, OperatorNode):
            raise TypeError("The root of a rule must be an instance of OperatorNode.")
        self.root = root
        # ... rest of initialization ...
```
**Explanation:**
*   The `root` of a rule *must* be an `OperatorNode`. This is because a rule is always about performing an operation (like "AND", "IF/THEN/ELSE") to produce a final outcome, not just a single constant or variable.

### 2. Essential Metadata

These are the "labels" and "details" on our recipe card that describe the rule:

*   **`rule_id`**: A unique identifier for the rule (e.g., `RULE_D_01_TREND_FOLLOW`). If not provided, a random UUID is generated.
*   **`name`**: A human-readable title (e.g., "Trend Following Score").
*   **`description`**: A longer explanation of what the rule does.
*   **`rule_status`**: Indicates if the rule is `READY`, `EVOLVING`, or `DEPRECATED`. Deprecated rules might return a neutral score (e.g., 0.0) or indicate they shouldn't be used.
*   **`created_at` / `updated_at`**: Timestamps for tracking when the rule was created or last modified.
*   **`metrics`**: (Optional) Stores performance metrics from backtesting the rule.

### 3. The `purpose` Property

This is a very important piece of metadata! The `purpose` property tells us *what kind of result* the rule is intended to produce. Is it a "Decision Signal" (telling us to buy/sell), a "Risk Level" (how risky is this stock?), or an "Opportunity Rating" (how good is this opportunity?).

The `Rule` automatically figures out its `purpose` from the `return_type` of its `root` node. This uses the `SemanticType` concept we introduced in [Chapter 5](05_rule_logic_tree__nodes__.md).

```python
# From itapia_common/rules/rule.py (simplified)
from itapia_common.schemas.entities.rules import SemanticType

class Rule:
    # ... (init method) ...

    @property
    def purpose(self) -> SemanticType:
        """Get the purpose of the rule based on the root node's return type."""
        return self.root.return_type # Direct link to the root node's output type
```
**Explanation:**
*   If your `root` node is an operator designed to produce a `DECISION_SIGNAL`, then the `Rule`'s `purpose` will automatically be `DECISION_SIGNAL`. This is how the system understands what a rule *means*.

### 4. Executing the Rule (`execute()`)

The `execute()` method is the main way to use a `Rule`. It takes a [Consolidated Analysis Report](04_consolidated_analysis_reports__.md) (our `QuickCheckAnalysisReport`) and passes it to its `root` logic tree for evaluation. It's a simple "facade" â€“ meaning it's a convenient front-door that hides the complex internal process of the logic tree.

```python
# From itapia_common/rules/rule.py (simplified)
from itapia_common.schemas.entities.analysis import QuickCheckAnalysisReport

class Rule:
    # ... (init and purpose property) ...

    def execute(self, report: QuickCheckAnalysisReport) -> float:
        """Execute the rule based on an analysis report and return the result."""
        if self.rule_status == RuleStatus.DEPRECATED:
            return 0.0 # Deprecated rules might return a neutral score
        return self.root.evaluate(report) # This calls the logic tree!
```
**Explanation:**
*   If the rule is marked as `DEPRECATED`, it returns `0.0` (a neutral score) without even evaluating the logic. This is a safety mechanism.
*   Otherwise, it simply calls `self.root.evaluate(report)`, which kicks off the recursive evaluation of the entire logic tree as we saw in [Chapter 5](05_rule_logic_tree__nodes__.md). The result is a single `float` score.

### 5. Storing and Retrieving Rules (`to_entity()` / `from_entity()`)

Just like with any important data, we need to save our rules to the database and load them back later. The `Rule` class provides `to_entity()` to convert itself into a [Pydantic Model](01_data_schemas__pydantic_models__.md) ([`RuleEntity`](itapia_common\schemas\entities\rules.py)) that can be easily stored (e.g., as JSON) in our PostgreSQL database (as discussed in [Chapter 3: Data Access Layer (CRUD & Services)](03_data_access_layer__crud___services__.md)). The `from_entity()` class method does the reverse, reconstructing a `Rule` object from the stored data.

These methods rely on the `parser` module (from Chapter 5's context) to serialize and parse the nested logic tree structure.

```python
# From itapia_common/rules/rule.py (simplified)
from typing import Self
from itapia_common.schemas.entities.rules import RuleEntity
from .parser import parse_tree, serialize_tree # From Chapter 5 context

class Rule:
    # ... (all methods above) ...

    def to_entity(self) -> RuleEntity:
        """Converts Rule object into a RuleEntity Pydantic model for storage."""
        # This converts the logic tree (self.root) into a nested dict
        serialized_root = serialize_tree(self.root)
        return RuleEntity(
            rule_id=self.rule_id,
            name=self.name,
            purpose=self.purpose,
            root=serialized_root, # The serialized logic tree
            # ... other fields ...
        )

    @classmethod
    def from_entity(cls, data: RuleEntity) -> Self:
        """Reconstructs a Rule object from a RuleEntity Pydantic model."""
        # This reconstructs the logic tree from the stored dictionary
        reconstructed_root = parse_tree(data.root)
        return cls(
            rule_id=data.rule_id,
            name=data.name,
            root=reconstructed_root, # The reconstructed logic tree
            # ... other fields ...
        )
```
**Explanation:**
*   `to_entity()` calls `serialize_tree()` to turn the `self.root` object into a nested dictionary structure that can be easily saved.
*   `from_entity()` takes the stored data, calls `parse_tree()` to recreate the `_TreeNode` objects, and then uses these to initialize a new `Rule` object.

## How to Use: Creating and Executing a Complete Rule

Let's take our example logic tree from [Chapter 5](05_rule_logic_tree__nodes__.md) ("Is RSI < 30 AND Forecast > 0?") and wrap it into a full `Rule` object.

First, we need to set up some mock nodes and a mock report, just like in Chapter 5.

```python

        ]
    )

    NodeEntity(

            },

Rule 'Reconstructed Rule' (ID: <some-uuid>) reconstructed from entity.
Reconstructed Rule Purpose: DECISION_SIGNAL
Reconstructed Rule executed! Resulting score: 1.0
```
As you can see, the `Rule` object successfully encapsulated our logic tree and its metadata. We could execute it, store it (via `to_entity`), and load it back (via `from_entity`), and it still worked perfectly!

## Under the Hood: The Rule Lifecycle

Hereâ€™s a simplified view of how a `Rule` fits into the broader system:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application Code
    participant RuleObj as Rule Object
    participant LogicTree as Root Node (OperatorNode)
    participant QCAR as QuickCheckAnalysisReport
    participant RuleEntity as RuleEntity (Pydantic Model)
    participant DB as Database (JSONB column)

    App->>RuleObj: Create Rule(logic_tree, metadata)
    RuleObj->>RuleObj: Stores logic_tree & metadata

    App->>RuleObj: score = execute(QCAR)
    RuleObj->>LogicTree: score = evaluate(QCAR)
    LogicTree-->>RuleObj: score
    RuleObj-->>App: score

    App->>RuleObj: rule_entity = to_entity()
    RuleObj->>LogicTree: serialized_tree = serialize_tree(LogicTree)
    LogicTree-->>RuleObj: serialized_tree (NodeEntity)
    RuleObj->>RuleEntity: Create RuleEntity(metadata, serialized_tree)
    RuleEntity-->>RuleObj: RuleEntity object
    RuleObj-->>App: RuleEntity

    App->>DB: Save RuleEntity (as JSONB)
    DB-->>App: (Saved)

    App->>DB: Load RuleEntity (from JSONB)
    DB-->>App: Loaded RuleEntity

    App->>RuleObj: new_rule = Rule.from_entity(loaded_rule_entity)
    RuleObj->>LogicTree: reconstructed_tree = parse_tree(loaded_rule_entity.root)
    LogicTree-->>RuleObj: reconstructed_tree
    RuleObj->>RuleObj: Create new Rule(reconstructed_tree, metadata)
    RuleObj-->>App: new_rule
```
This diagram illustrates the full journey of a `Rule`: from creation, through execution, to storage (as a `RuleEntity` using `serialize_tree`), and finally reconstruction (using `parse_tree`).

## Why the `Rule` Class Is So Powerful (Benefits)

1.  **Encapsulation:** It neatly bundles the complex logic tree with all its important metadata, creating a single, self-contained unit.
2.  **Clear Identity & Purpose:** Each rule has a name, description, and a defined `purpose` (like `DECISION_SIGNAL`), making it easy to understand what it does and how to use its output.
3.  **Unified Execution Interface:** Regardless of how complex the underlying logic tree is, you always execute a rule by calling `rule.execute(report)`. This consistent interface simplifies integration with other parts of the system.
4.  **Persistence:** The `to_entity()` and `from_entity()` methods allow rules to be easily saved to and loaded from a database, making them durable and reusable across application restarts.
5.  **Status Management:** The `rule_status` allows for lifecycle management, preventing deprecated rules from being accidentally executed.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we've brought everything together by exploring the **`Rule` class**, the central "recipe card" for all business rules in `itapia`. We've seen how it encapsulates a powerful [Rule Logic Tree (Nodes)](05_rule_logic_tree__nodes__.md) with essential metadata like `rule_id`, `name`, `description`, `rule_status`, and its all-important `purpose`. We also learned how to `execute()` a rule against a [Consolidated Analysis Report](04_consolidated_analysis_reports__.md) and how to save/load rules using its `to_entity()` and `from_entity()` methods.

Now that we know how to define and execute rules to get a numerical score, the next logical step is to understand what these scores *mean* and how `itapia` maps them to concrete actions or insights for users.
