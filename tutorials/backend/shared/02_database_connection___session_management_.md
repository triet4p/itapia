# Chapter 2: Database Connection & Session Management

Welcome back! In our [first chapter: Data Schemas (Pydantic Models)](01_data_schemas__pydantic_models__.md), we learned how to create "blueprints" for our data using Pydantic Models. These blueprints ensure that our information is always organized, correct, and reliable. But what good are perfectly structured blueprints if we have nowhere to store the actual buildings, or no way to access them later?

## The Problem: How Do We Store and Access Our Organized Data?

Imagine you've meticulously designed a beautiful user profile using a Pydantic Model. Now, you need to save this profile so that when the user returns tomorrow, their information is still there. Or perhaps you need to fetch historical stock prices that you've previously stored.

Our `itapia` project uses two main types of databases:

1.  **PostgreSQL (RDBMS):** This is like a highly organized filing cabinet, perfect for structured data like user profiles, stock metadata, and detailed reports.
2.  **Redis:** This is a super-fast in-memory store, great for temporary data or things that need to be accessed incredibly quickly, like live intraday stock prices.

Connecting to these databases, asking them for information, and saving new data can be tricky. We need to:
*   Make sure our application can *find* the databases.
*   Connect to them efficiently, not wasting resources.
*   Ensure that when many parts of our application (or many users) try to access the database at the same time, they don't step on each other's toes. Each interaction should be isolated and clean.
*   Gracefully close connections when we're done.

This is where "Database Connection & Session Management" comes in!

## The Solution: Our Database Receptionist & Concierge

Think of our database management system as the **receptionist and concierge** for our databases.

*   **The Receptionist (Connection):** There's only *one* main receptionist desk for our databases. This receptionist knows *how* to connect to PostgreSQL and Redis. Once connected, this connection is kept open and reused, so we don't have to keep opening new "front doors" every time someone wants to get in. We call this a **singleton pattern** – one central, shared connection.
*   **The Concierge (Session):** When a "guest" (like a new request to our application) arrives and needs to do something with the database, the concierge assigns them their *own private, temporary workspace* – this is called a **database session**. This session is just for that guest, so they can work without disturbing others. Once the guest is finished, the concierge politely cleans up their workspace and closes it, ready for the next guest.

This system ensures efficient use of resources and prevents data conflicts.

## Key Concepts Explained

Let's break down the core ideas behind how `itapia` handles this:

### 1. Database Configuration: Knowing Where to Go

Before we can connect, we need to know the database's address, username, and password. This information is usually kept separate from the main code (e.g., in environment variables) for security and flexibility.

Our project defines these details in `itapia_common/dblib/db_config.py`. It constructs a special string called a `DATABASE_URL` for PostgreSQL.

```python
# From itapia_common/dblib/db_config.py (simplified)
import os
from urllib.parse import quote_plus

# ... (environment variable loading happens here) ...

POSTGRES_USER = os.getenv("POSTGRES_USER")
POSTGRES_PASSWORD = quote_plus(os.getenv("POSTGRES_PASSWORD")) # Securely encoded
POSTGRES_DB = os.getenv("POSTGRES_DB")
POSTGRES_HOST = os.getenv("POSTGRES_HOST", "localhost")
POSTGRES_PORT = os.getenv("POSTGRES_PORT", 5432)

DATABASE_URL = f"postgresql+psycopg2://{POSTGRES_USER}:{POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@{POSTGRES_HOST}:{POSTGRES_PORT}/{POSTGRES_DB}"
# Example: postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb

REDIS_HOST = os.getenv("REDIS_HOST", "localhost")
REDIS_PORT = int(os.getenv("REDIS_PORT", 6379))
```
This `db_config.py` file is essentially our project's "address book" for the databases, telling us exactly where to find PostgreSQL and Redis using environment variables.

### 2. Singleton Connections: One Main Entrance

For efficiency, we don't want to establish a brand new connection to PostgreSQL or Redis every single time our application needs to interact with them. It's much better to open *one* connection and reuse it. This is the **singleton pattern**.

In `itapia`, this is managed in `itapia_common/dblib/session.py`.

```python
# From itapia_common/dblib/session.py (simplified)
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import redis
from . import db_config as cfg # Our address book!

_SINGLETON_RDBMS_ENGINE = None # Our PostgreSQL "receptionist"
_SINGLETON_REDIS_CLIENT = None # Our Redis "receptionist"

def get_singleton_rdbms_engine():
    global _SINGLETON_RDBMS_ENGINE
    if _SINGLETON_RDBMS_ENGINE is None:
        # Create the engine ONLY ONCE
        _SINGLETON_RDBMS_ENGINE = create_engine(cfg.DATABASE_URL)
    return _SINGLETON_RDBMS_ENGINE

def get_singleton_redis_client():
    global _SINGLETON_REDIS_CLIENT
    if _SINGLETON_REDIS_CLIENT is None:
        # Create the Redis client ONLY ONCE
        _SINGLETON_REDIS_CLIENT = redis.Redis(
            host=cfg.REDIS_HOST, port=cfg.REDIS_PORT
        )
        _SINGLETON_REDIS_CLIENT.ping() # Check if connection works!
    return _SINGLETON_REDIS_CLIENT
```
These functions ensure that no matter how many times you call `get_singleton_rdbms_engine()` or `get_singleton_redis_client()`, you always get the *exact same* connection object. It's like having one consistent receptionist at the main desk.

### 3. Session Management: Private Workspaces for Each Request

Even though we have one shared connection (the receptionist), each "guest" (application request) needs its own, isolated workspace. This is the **database session**.

For PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy (a powerful Python library) helps us manage these sessions. For Redis, we usually just share the client itself since Redis operations are often simpler and don't require the same "transactional" isolation.

Let's look at the functions that provide these sessions, also in `itapia_common/dblib/session.py`. These are designed to be used with web frameworks like FastAPI.

```python
# From itapia_common/dblib/session.py (simplified)
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session
from typing import Generator # Special type for functions that 'yield'

# ... (get_singleton_rdbms_engine and get_singleton_redis_client defined above) ...

def get_rdbms_session() -> Generator[Session, None, None]:
    """Provides a fresh PostgreSQL database session for each request."""
    engine = get_singleton_rdbms_engine() # Get our one shared connection
    SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
    session = SessionLocal() # Create a NEW, isolated session for THIS request
    try:
        yield session # Give the session to the requesting code
    finally:
        session.close() # ALWAYS close the session when done

def get_redis_connection() -> Generator[redis.Redis | None, None, None]:
    """Provides the shared Redis client."""
    yield get_singleton_redis_client() # Just give out the one shared client
```
*   `get_rdbms_session()`: This function is special. It uses `yield` to give a database session to whoever asks for it. The `try...finally` block is crucial: it guarantees that `session.close()` is called, cleaning up the private workspace, even if something goes wrong during the request. This prevents resource leaks!
*   `get_redis_connection()`: Since Redis works differently, we simply `yield` the one shared Redis client.

These are our "concierges," ensuring each guest gets a clean workspace and that it's tidied up afterward.

### 4. FastAPI Dependencies: Asking for What You Need

Our `itapia` project uses a web framework called FastAPI. FastAPI has a fantastic feature called "Dependency Injection." This means that when a part of our application needs a database session or a Redis connection, it doesn't have to worry about *how* to get it. It just "declares" what it needs, and FastAPI automatically provides it using functions like `get_rdbms_session` and `get_redis_connection`.

You'll see this in `itapia_common/dblib/dependencies.py`.

```python
# From itapia_common/dblib/dependencies.py (simplified)
from fastapi import Depends
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from redis.client import Redis

from .session import get_rdbms_session, get_redis_connection
# From .services import APIMetadataService # (from next chapter)

def get_metadata_service(
    rdbms_session: Session = Depends(get_rdbms_session),
) -> APIMetadataService: # (APIMetadataService will be covered in the next chapter)
    """FastAPI will automatically provide a database session here."""
    # This service (which does actual database operations)
    # now has a clean, isolated database session to work with.
    return APIMetadataService(rdbms_session)

def get_prices_service(
    rdbms_session: Session = Depends(get_rdbms_session),
    redis_client: Redis = Depends(get_redis_connection),
    # ... other dependencies ...
) -> APIPricesService:
    """This service needs BOTH a PostgreSQL session and a Redis client."""
    return APIPricesService(rdbms_session, redis_client, # ...)
```
Here, `Depends(get_rdbms_session)` and `Depends(get_redis_connection)` tell FastAPI: "Before you run `get_metadata_service`, please call `get_rdbms_session` and give me the `Session` object it provides." This keeps our code clean and reusable!

## How It All Works Together (Simplified Flow)

When an external request (e.g., from a user's web browser or another service) comes into our `itapia` application and needs to interact with the database, here’s a simplified sequence of events:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant WebRequest as Incoming Web Request
    participant FastAPI as Our Application Framework
    participant GetRDBMSSessionFunc as get_rdbms_session()
    participant SingletonEngine as Singleton RDBMS Engine
    participant PostgreSQL as PostgreSQL Database

    WebRequest->>FastAPI: "I need user data!"
    FastAPI->>GetRDBMSSessionFunc: "Hey, give me a database session."
    GetRDBMSSessionFunc->>SingletonEngine: "Do we have an engine yet? (No/Yes)"
    alt First Request
        SingletonEngine->>PostgreSQL: (Once) Establish persistent connection
    end
    SingletonEngine-->>GetRDBMSSessionFunc: Returns engine
    GetRDBMSSessionFunc->>PostgreSQL: Create a NEW, temporary session
    PostgreSQL-->>GetRDBMSSessionFunc: Returns new session
    GetRDBMSSessionFunc-->>FastAPI: Here's your session.
    FastAPI->>FastAPI: Uses session to fetch/save data
    FastAPI->>GetRDBMSSessionFunc: Request finished, return session
    GetRDBMSSessionFunc->>PostgreSQL: (Implicitly) Close/release the session
```

This diagram shows how FastAPI orchestrates the process: it asks `get_rdbms_session` for a session, which in turn ensures the database engine is ready and then provides a clean, isolated session for that specific request. Once the request is done, the session is properly closed.

## Why This Approach Is So Powerful (Benefits)

1.  **Resource Efficiency:** By using singleton connections, we avoid the overhead of constantly opening and closing database connections, which is expensive.
2.  **Data Isolation:** Each request gets its own session, preventing different parts of the application from interfering with each other's database operations. This is crucial for data integrity.
3.  **Automatic Cleanup:** The `try...finally` block in `get_rdbms_session` guarantees that database sessions are always closed, preventing resource leaks and ensuring our system remains stable.
4.  **Clean Code:** FastAPI's dependency injection makes our application code much cleaner. Services that need database access just `Depends` on `get_rdbms_session` or `get_redis_connection` and receive a ready-to-use object, without needing to know the low-level details of how it was created.
5.  **Flexibility:** If we ever needed to switch databases or change connection logic, we'd only need to modify `db_config.py` and `session.py`, not every part of our application that uses a database.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we've explored the crucial role of Database Connection & Session Management in our `itapia` project. We learned how `itapia` efficiently connects to PostgreSQL and Redis using a **singleton pattern** for main connections, and how it provides isolated **sessions** for each application request. This "receptionist and concierge" system, powered by SQLAlchemy and FastAPI dependencies, ensures our data operations are efficient, safe, and well-organized, building upon the structured data we defined in [Chapter 1: Data Schemas (Pydantic Models)](01_data_schemas__pydantic_models__.md).

Now that we understand how to connect to our databases and manage sessions, the next logical step is to learn how to actually *perform* operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting our structured data. In the next chapter, we'll dive into the **Data Access Layer**, which provides the tools and services to interact with our databases.
